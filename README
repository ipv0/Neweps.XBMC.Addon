NewEps - XBMC plugin

(Work in progress)
(though the plugin works fine in my xbmc and used on a weekly basis)

Useful when automatic RSS downloading is set up in the torrent client for TV episodes, set
to save in a given directory.

Script checks the given directory for downloaded tv episodes, lists them, parses (scene release) names, loads episode info from TheTVDB.

Playing an episode removes it from the list as watched (with an option to restore and others)

As the result, the plugin shows unwatched episodes + the new ones that were automatically
added by the torrent client.

It's a plugin for XBMC, so XBMC has to be installed.

And copy all files from this repo into that folder.

It will appear in XBMC under Programs.
